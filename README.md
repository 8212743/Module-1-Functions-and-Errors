Here's a README file for your AssertionExample contract:

```
# AssertionExample - Solidity Contract with Assertion Examples

## Overview
AssertionExample is a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the use of assertions (`require`, `assert`, and `revert`) for input validation and to ensure certain conditions are met during execution.

## Features
- **Input Validation**: The contract validates inputs using the `require` statement to ensure that certain conditions are met before proceeding with the execution.
- **Invariant Checking**: It utilizes the `assert` statement to check for conditions that should never be false during execution.
- **Custom Error Messages**: The `revert` statement is used to revert the transaction with a custom error message if certain conditions are not met.

## Functions
### `setValue(uint256 _value)`
- Sets the value of `someValue`.
- Uses `require` to validate that `_value` is not zero.
- Uses `assert` to ensure `_value` is not equal to 999.
- Sets `someValue` to `_value`.

### `setValueWithRevert(uint256 _value)`
- Sets the value of `someValue`.
- Uses `revert` to revert the transaction with a custom error message if `_value` is equal to 999.
- Sets `someValue` to `_value`.

## Usage
Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network and interact with it using Ethereum wallets, dApps, or other smart contracts.

## Example
Here's an example of how to interact with the AssertionExample contract:

```javascript
// Deploy AssertionExample
const AssertionExample = await ethers.getContractFactory("AssertionExample");
const assertionExample = await AssertionExample.deploy();

// Set value with input validation and assertion
await assertionExample.setValue(123);

// Attempt to set value to 999 (should trigger assertion)
await assertionExample.setValue(999); // This will fail

// Set value with revert and custom error message
await assertionExample.setValueWithRevert(456);

// Attempt to set value to 999 (should revert with custom error message)
await assertionExample.setValueWithRevert(999); // This will revert
```
